My name is Alissa. I'm a network and systems engineer, working in cyber security. I'm really interested in technology, and like to figure out how things works on a lower level.

This blog exists so I can publish my SIEM related tutorials that I couldn't really find online, so that I had to stitch together myself. I hope it will have some value to anyone who finds this place.
